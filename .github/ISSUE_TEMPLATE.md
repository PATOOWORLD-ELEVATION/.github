<!--
Thank you for reporting an issue!

Remember, this issue tracker is for reporting issues ONLY with node-gyp.

If you have an issue installing a specific module, please file an issue on
that module's issue tracker (`npm issues modulename`). Open issue here only if
you are sure this is an issue with node-gyp, not with the module you are
trying to build.

Fill out the form below. We probably won't investigate an issue that does not
provide the basic information we require.

-->

Please look thru your error log for the string `gyp info using node-gyp@` and if the version number is less than the [current release of node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/releases) then __please upgrade__ using the instructions at https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/Updating-npm-bundled-node-gyp.md and try your command again.

Requests for help with [`node-sass` are very common](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues?q=label%3A%22Node+Sass+--%3E+Dart+Sass%22). Please be aware that this package is deprecated, you should seek alternatives and avoid opening new issues about it here.

* **Node Version**: <!-- `node -v` and `npm -v` -->

* **Compiler**: <!-- `cc -v` (UNIX) or `msbuild /version & cl` (Windows) -->
